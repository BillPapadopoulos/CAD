The function of this System is to read specific keys from a keyboard, with which we select
one of 6 screen windows. As long as we have chosen one
window, we can configure its color to one of 512 possible colors. The color of each window is
completely independent of the rest.
The sub-designs that make up the System are:
1.The Keyboard controller, which is responsible for reading specific keys from the keyboard.
2.The Display controller, which is responsible for displaying on a screen via VGA protocol.
